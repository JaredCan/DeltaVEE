{"name":"Delta VEE","tagline":"Android App for Calculating the Potential Velocity of a Rocket","body":"### What is Delta VEE?\r\nDelta VEE is an android app that uses the tsiolkovsky rocket equation to calculate the potential change in velocity (otherwise known as Delta V or dV) of a rocket. This is my first app, so it's pretty simple, but it works well and looks nice.\r\n\r\n### What's in the .zip and .tar?\r\nIncluded in the compressed download files are the .java source codes, the layout files and the string file necessary to review the code and build the app yourself, just extra proof that it's not doing anything it's not supposed to.\r\n \r\n### How do I use Delta VEE?\r\nCalculating the dV of a single stage rocket is straightforward enough, just plug in the numbers and press the button. However to calculate a multi stage rocket, start by calculating the dV of the very last stage, using the weight of rocket when it is at that stage, then press \"add stage\" on the result screen. when calculating the weight of the rocket, make sure to include the weight of the stages above it and fuel not burned during the stage you're calculating!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
